This Repository is a host of all the applications I've worked on in my spare time, for the Mac OS X Operating Systems.

Currently, the repo isn't very organized, and i would like to change that soon.

The apps are developed using a standard, albeit informal iterative develoment process, as I am just now learning the API's associated with the Darwin system. 

I doubt the apps fill a need.
